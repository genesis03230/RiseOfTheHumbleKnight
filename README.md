## üéÆ Overview  
**Rise of the Humble Knight** is a **2D Pixel Art RPG** developed in under one week as part of a **technical test for Team Brunomir**.  
Built entirely solo in Unity, the game combines **exploration, interactive dialogue systems, turn-based combat**, and **cinematic storytelling**, offering a full narrative and gameplay experience from start to finish.  

Despite being my **first 2D Unity project**, the prototype achieved a complete, playable game featuring multiple environments, progression, and narrative sequences ‚Äî all within an incredibly short timeframe.  

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Project Context  
This project was part of an entry challenge for **Team Brunomir**, an indie studio seeking developers specialized in RPG systems and dialogue implementation.  
While the original task required only a dialogue prototype and a mini-game, I expanded the scope to create a **fully playable RPG prototype**, complete with combat and narrative flow.  

The project led me to be **shortlisted among the top two candidates** out of hundreds of applicants.  
Although another developer was ultimately selected, this experience showcased my ability to **design, prototype, and deliver complete systems independently**.
